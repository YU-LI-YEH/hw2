Use up and down button to select a frequency on uLCD and then press confirm.
We make a triangle waveform form the signal of mBed, then the signal goes through the low pass filter.
We series two resistors so that the cut off frequency won't be too high.
Only the low frequency signal will pass. When the frequency is higher than the cut off frequency, there is almost zero voltage.
Connect to picoscope to adjust the perriod of one triangle wave be the same as the 1/frequency we select.(use waiting function)
We also write the value of Vout into ADCdata and print them on screen.
The python code will read the value in ADCdata and then plot the figure.
